h1. What is the problem?

The name {{<%lyr.data_name%>}} is ### *_parsable but not valid_*. These bits look wrong:

<%#invalid_clause_list%>
* {{<%invalid_clause%>}}
<%/invalid_clause_list%>

* "*ourairports*" is not a recognised value for the clause "source"

These bits look OK:

<%#valid_clause_list%>
* {{<%valid_clause%>}}
<%/valid_clause_list%>

h1. What is the likely consequence of this problem?

This may result in the failure add a layer to one or more maps, if that layer depends on this dataset on maps

h1. How can this problem be resolved?

If the name is ### "*_parsable but not valid_*"; The name is close enough to the relevant naming convention the MapChef can have a guess at the intended name and highlight the clauses that look wrong and look OK. Try one of the following:

* Update the filename to correct any clauses that are not recognised.
* OR If you need a country specific value for one or more clause then added the values into the relevant .csv file located in this directory; {{\GIS\2_Active_Data\200_data_name_lookup\}}

If the name is ### "*_not parsable_*"; MapChef could not guess what the intended name is. Possible reasons for this include:

* The name does not closely resemble the name convention.
* One or more clauses are missing means that there are not enough clauses in the name.
* The wrong character is used to separate the clauses in the name (eg check for {{_}} vs {{-}})
